## Conventions
 
- Status: `[ ]` not yet verified · `[x]` passing on current main.
- ID prefix indicates suite: `ENV`, `CRAWL`, `OCR`, `LLM`, `ING`, `VEC`, `RRF`, `GRAPH`, `API`, `UI`, `DEMO`, `DISC`, `PERF`, `FAIL`.
- Severity: `P0` blocks demo · `P1` degrades demo · `P2` quality polish.
- Type: `Unit` · `Integration` · `Manual` · `Boundary`.
- A test flips to `[x]` only when its `Asserts` line holds AND its linked task in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) is `[x]`.

## 4. Live UI Integration Tests
 
Validates the React surface end-to-end against a running FastAPI. **Suite total: 12** (P0: 6 · P1: 6 · P2: 0).
 
- [ ] **TC-API-001** · P0 · Integration — Search response schema.
  - Asserts: `GET /search?q=panic` body deserializes into `SearchResponse` per [CLAUDE.md §2.3](CLAUDE.md#23-fastapi-search-schema); invariant `len(results) == count` holds.
  - Tracks: [T-2.1.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-21--pydantic-contracts).
- [ ] **TC-API-002** · P1 · Boundary — Weight validation.
  - Asserts: `GET /search?q=x&visual_weight=0&irony_weight=0` returns HTTP 422, not silent default.
  - Tracks: [T-2.1.2](TASKS.md#feature-f-21--pydantic-contracts).
- [ ] **TC-UI-001** · P0 · Manual — Cold-start search.
  - Asserts: fresh page load, type query, hit enter — grid renders within 3s with ≥ 1 result.
  - Tracks: [T-3.1.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-31--react-shell), [T-3.1.2](TASKS.md#feature-f-31--react-shell).

- [ ] **TC-UI-003** · P0 · Manual — Live slider rebinding.
  - Asserts: slider drag from 0.0 to 1.0 triggers refetch (debounced ≤ 300ms); top-1 tile visibly changes.
  - Tracks: [T-3.2.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-32--weight-slider--rrf-visibility).
- [ ] **TC-UI-004** · P0 · Manual — Detail modal.
  - Asserts: click any result — modal shows `core_joke`, `psychological_state`, `subtext_context`, and lineage block. Esc closes.
  - Tracks: [T-3.2.2](TASKS.md#feature-f-32--weight-slider--rrf-visibility).
- [ ] **TC-UI-005** · P1 · Manual — Empty state.
  - Asserts: type a deliberately unmatched query — UI shows "no memes match", not a broken grid.

  - Tracks: [T-3.3.2](TASKS.md#feature-f-33--failure-surfaces).
- [ ] **TC-UI-007** · P1 · Manual — Small-sample "accumulating baseline" banner.
  - Asserts: open the Meme Mutation Radar panel for a meme whose template has `< MUTATION_MIN_MEMBERS` (5) members; the panel replaces the live velocity graph with the banner "Accumulating baseline data: This template requires at least 5 instances for drift telemetry." No velocity bar is shown.
  - Note: this is the KSP 1 UI case the spec requested as "TC-UI-001"; that ID was already taken by Cold-start search, so it lands here as TC-UI-007 — see [implementation-notes-ui.html](implementation-notes-ui.html) (mirrors the TC-VEC / TC-FAIL renames in [implementation-notes.md](implementation-notes.md)).
  - Tracks: [T-5.2.3](TASKS.md#feature-f-52--meme-mutation-radar-dashboard-panel-frontend), [T-5.2.4](TASKS.md#feature-f-52--meme-mutation-radar-dashboard-panel-frontend).
- [ ] **TC-UI-008** · P1 · Manual — Trend Velocity badge state.
  - Asserts: when the selected meme's template carries `trending_mutation == true`, the badge reads "Trending Mutation" (High Velocity) with the flame/graph treatment; when `false`, it reads "Stable Format". Driven by the mapped `trending_mutation` payload property.
  - Note: this is the KSP 1 UI case the spec requested as "TC-UI-002"; that ID was already taken by Grid responsiveness, so it lands here as TC-UI-008 — see [implementation-notes-ui.html](implementation-notes-ui.html).
  - Tracks: [T-5.2.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-52--meme-mutation-radar-dashboard-panel-frontend), [T-5.2.2](TASKS.md#feature-f-52--meme-mutation-radar-dashboard-panel-frontend).
- [ ] **TC-DEMO-004** · P0 · Manual — RRF sweep visually.

  - Tracks: [T-X.1](TASKS.md#cross-cutting-spans-all-sprints).
- [ ] **TC-DISC-002** · P0 · Unit — Async loop audit.
  - Asserts: static check — every public function in `backend/main.py`, `backend/search.py`, `backend/ingest.py` is `async def`; every Twelve Labs / Mistral / Qdrant / Neo4j call site is either awaited or wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`. Spec: [CLAUDE.md §3.2](CLAUDE.md#32-async-processing-loops).
  - Tracks: [T-1.4.4](TASKS.md#feature-f-14--vector--graph-upsert).
- [ ] **TC-DISC-003** · P0 · Unit — Vendor containment.

## 6. Failure Boundary Assertions
 
Edge-case behavior that protects the demo from disaster. **Suite total: 9** (P0: 3 · P1: 4 · P2: 2).
 
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-001** · P0 · Boundary — Dead Twelve Labs key.
  - Asserts: invalid `TL_API_KEY` at ingest time — affected memes land in a quarantine list; pipeline continues for the rest; no Qdrant point upserted with empty `visual` vector.
  - Tracks: [T-1.3.2](TASKS.md#feature-f-13--mistral-structured-decoder), [T-1.4.4](TASKS.md#feature-f-14--vector--graph-upsert).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-002** · P0 · Boundary — Dead Mistral key.
  - Asserts: invalid `MISTRAL_API_KEY` at ingest time — decoder raises `DecodeError`; ingestion task records the failure with Reddit `id`; pipeline does not crash. Spec: [CLAUDE.md §2.1 failure-mode contract](CLAUDE.md#21-mistral-decoder-output-schema).
  - Tracks: [T-1.3.2](TASKS.md#feature-f-13--mistral-structured-decoder).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-003** · P0 · Boundary — Zero-result multi-vector.
  - Asserts: query that exists in irony space but with `visual_weight=1.0, irony_weight=0.0` and no matching visual neighbors — endpoint returns `count: 0, results: []`. Spec: [CLAUDE.md §2.3 invariant 4](CLAUDE.md#23-fastapi-search-schema).
  - Tracks: [T-2.3.3](TASKS.md#feature-f-23--rrf-fusion-via-universal-query-api), [T-3.3.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-33--failure-surfaces).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-004** · P1 · Boundary — OCR returns garbage.
  - Asserts: OCR yields 200 chars of noise on a screenshot meme; Mistral decoder still produces a valid `MemeDecodeSchema` by leaning on the post title alone.
  - Tracks: [T-1.3.3](TASKS.md#feature-f-13--mistral-structured-decoder).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-005** · P1 · Boundary — Neo4j unavailable mid-search.
  - Asserts: stop Neo4j; `/search` still returns the RRF-ranked memes but with `lineage.template = null, lineage.variants = []`. Never 500.
  - Tracks: [T-2.4.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-24--lineage-join).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-006** · P1 · Boundary — Qdrant unavailable.
  - Asserts: stop Qdrant; `/search` returns HTTP 503 with a structured error body; FastAPI does not leak stack trace.
  - Tracks: [T-2.3.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-23--rrf-fusion-via-universal-query-api).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-007** · P2 · Boundary — Oversized query.

  - Tracks: [T-2.1.1](TASKS.md#feature-f-21--pydantic-contracts).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-008** · P2 · Boundary — Image disappears between crawl and ingest.
  - Asserts: manually delete one image file; ingest task for that meme is quarantined; the rest proceed.
  - Tracks: [T-1.4.4](TASKS.md#feature-f-14--vector--graph-upsert).
- [ ] **TC-FAIL-009** · P1 · Boundary — Small-sample mutation guardrail.
  - Asserts: a template with `< 5` members run through `scripts/compute_mutation_metrics.py` defaults `velocity` to `0.0` and forces `trending_mutation = false` without raising; the template is flagged "accumulating baseline data" and velocity computation is bypassed. Spec: [implementation-notes.md](implementation-notes.md).
  - Note: this is the KSP 1 guardrail the spec requested as "TC-FAIL-007"; that ID was already taken by Oversized query, so it lands here as TC-FAIL-009 — see [implementation-notes.md](implementation-notes.md).
  - Tracks: [T-5.1.4](TASKS.md#feature-f-51--meme-mutation-radar-implementation).
